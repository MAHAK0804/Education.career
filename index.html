        JEE(JOINT ENTRANCE EXAM)
        <hr>
    </h1>
    <p1>
        The JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) is an entrance exam for admission into various engineering colleges across
        the country.
        One of the most-challenging entrance exams in the country.
        JEE conducted in two parts:<br><br>
        <li>
            JEE MAIN
        </li>
        <li>
            JEE ADVANCED
        </li>
    </p1><br><br>
    <p2>

        Institutes like the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs),
        Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, and the Indian Institute of Science consider
        the marks obtained in JEE Advanced as one of the criteria for admission. However,
        these institutes are not a part of central IIT-JEE Advanced counselling.
    </p2>
    <h2 style="color:red;" id="jeemain">
        JEE-MAINS
    </h2>
    <p2>
        JEE-Main is conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA).
        JEE-Main has two papers, Paper-I and Paper-II.
        Candidates may opt for either or both of them.
        Both papers contain multiple choice questions.
        Paper-I is for admission to B.E./B.Tech courses and is conducted in a Computer Based Test mode.
        Paper-II is for admission in B.Arch and B.Planning courses and will also be conducted in Computer Based Test
        mode
        except for one paper, namely the 'Drawing Test' which shall be conducted in Pen and Paper mode or offline mode.
        From January 2020 onwards, an additional Paper-III is being introduced for B.Planning courses separately.
        Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, JEE-Main 2021 has a change in paper format and number of attempts.
        Now there will be 20 single choice questions and 10 numerical questions out of which only five numerical
        questions are to be attempted. The marking scheme is same as earlier i.e. for SCQs, +4 marks for correct answer
        and -1 marks for incorrect answer and 0 marks for not answered, and for numerical type questions, +4 marks for
        correct and 0 for incorrect.
        JEE-Main, unlike JEE-Advanced, has a fixed exam structure and is not subject to change every year.
        Up until 2018, the JEE-Main Paper-I is of three hours duration and consists of thirty single choice questions in
        each of the three subjects
        (physics, chemistry and maths). 4 marks are awarded for correct answers and 1 mark is deducted for incorrect
        answers.
        Students taking this exam are usually in the age group 18-20.
        A new pattern consisting of 20+5 questions per subject was introduced in January 2020 with 20 single choice
        questions + 5 numerical type questions by NTA.
        In single-choice questions 4 marks are awarded for correct answers and no marks are deducted from numerical type
        questions.
        From 2013 to 2016, the marks obtained in the class XII school board examination used to be accorded a 40%
        weightage in deciding the JEE-Main all India ranks.

    <h2 style="color:red;" id="jeeadv">
        JEE-ADVANCED
    </h2>
    <p2>
        JEE-Advanced is conducted for entry into 23 IIT's and some other equally prestigious
        universities like IISC Bangalore, IIST Thiruvananthapuram, Indian Institute of Petroleum and
        Energy (IIPE), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISERs), Rajiv Gandhi
        Institute of Petroleum Technology (RGIPT). This exam is conducted by any one of the IIT's every
        year. In 2020, the exam was conducted by IIT Delhi. In 2021, 2022, and 2023, it shall be conducted
        by IIT Kharagpur, IIT Bombay and IIT Guwahati respectively. More than 2 lakh students become eligible
        to write JEE-Advanced every year. The top 250,000 students of JEE Main qualify to appear for the
        JEE-Advanced examination. In 2018, 224,000 students were appeared to take the JEE-Advanced,
        a number that had gone up from 220,000 in 2017 and 200,000 in 2016.

        </h2>
        <p1>
            <li>
                Those who have cleared their Class XII exam,
                or any equivalent qualifying examination ; OR those who are appearing in their Class XII exam,
                are eligible to appear in JEE Main.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Candidates can appear for JEE Advanced for a maximum of two consecutive years.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Those with a Diploma can now also apply for JEE, but only for admission in IITs.
                These candidates also need to appear for JEE Advanced.
            </li>

            EXAM PATTERN
        </h2>
        <p1>
            Each paper can be attempted in English, or Hindi, or other languages, based on examination center location.
            The patterns of the JEE Main and JEE Advanced papers also differ.
